# Metrics Guidelines

Metrics can be categorised into 3 groups, Work, Resource and Events

## Work Metrics

Indicate overall, top-level health. They can be broken down into 4 subtypes:

- Throughput: Amount of work per unit of time (eg RDS queries per second)
- Success: Portion of work executed successfully (eg RDS queries/query errors)
- Error: Number, rate or percentage of erroneous results (eg RDS query errors)
- Performance: Measurement of how efficiently a component is doing work (eg RDS read query latency)

## Resource Metrics

This can be thought of as the physical resources that a system relies upon. The following key areas can be used:

- Utilisation: Percentage of time that the resource is busy or how much of the resource's capacity is in use (eg RDS open database connections)
- Saturation: Amount of requested work that the resource cannot yet service (eg RDS disk queue depth)
- Error: Internal errors that may not be observable in the work the resource produces (eg RDS failed connection attempts)
- Availability: Percentage of time that the resource responded to events

## Events

Events capture what happened at a specific point in time. They can help to provide context:

- Changes (code releases, builds and build failures)
- Alerts (notifications generated by the primary monitoring system)
- Scaling events (adding or subtracting hosts or containers)
